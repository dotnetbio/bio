This directory is the root Attribution point for all the Open Source 
tools we use in our build process.  Each sub-directory has an URL 
linking to the original location where we downloaded the tool 
binaries and/or source from.  If a binary was not available from the 
main distribution point, the tool used to build .Net Bio can be built 
from the sources in the appropriate directory.
